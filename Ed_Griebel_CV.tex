The department I was in created training exercises for new developers to introduce them to the tools and development environment. I worked with each new developer to review their answers to the Java exercises,  answer questions as they worked through them, and working through topics new to them.

I gave quarterly presentations to the extended team to introduce Java technologies and internal systems. Topics included web application redesigns and base functionality, Java JSP and servlet development, and web testing techniques.

As a Java team lead, I was responsible for a small team of developers. Since this was the first job after college for some, as we reviewed their code I would see opportunities to mentor them on advanced Java and JavaScript concepts and topics.

\CodeCommand{SubSection\{a\}\{b\}\{c\}}
to create sections and subsections, where
\Code{a} is the heading displayed on the page,
\Code{b} is the PDF bookmark heading, and
\Code{c} is the internal PDF link (must be unique).
Sections and subsections will appear in the PDF bookmarks.

the latter will reset the paragraph indentation.

To create a new paragraph, use \CodeCommand{par} or simply leave an empty line.
Paragraph indentations (from
\CodeCommand{Entry},
\CodeCommand{BulletItem},
\CodeCommand{SubBulletItem},
\CodeCommand{Item},
\CodeCommand{SubItem},
\CodeCommand{NumberedItem},
etc.) do not carry across different paragraphs.

(e.g., \CodeCommand{DatestampYMD\{2008\}\{01\}\{15\}})
\SubBulletItem
\CodeCommand{DatestampYM\{yyyy\}\{MM\}}
(e.g., \CodeCommand{DatestampYM\{2008\}\{01\}})
\SubBulletItem
\CodeCommand{DatestampY\{yyyy\}}
(e.g., \CodeCommand{DatestampY\{2008\}})

\Code{ddMMMyyyy} (``15~Jan~2008'')
\SubBulletItem
\Code{MMMMyyyy} (``January~2008'')
