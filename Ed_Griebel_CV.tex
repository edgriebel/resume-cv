Paychex, Inc.
\begin{Detail}
\BulletItem
As one of the technical leads for Java, developers on the extended team would come to me when they had deep technical questions about their code or odd errors that they couldn't track down. I would also have conversations with experienced developers to determine the ``best'' solution for a problem that would meet given technical or scheduling constraints.
\BulletItem
The department I was in created training exercises for new developers to introduce them to the tools and development environment. I worked with each new developer to review their answers to the Java exercises,  answer questions as they worked through them, and working through topics new to them.
\BulletItem
I gave quarterly presentations to the extended team to introduce Java technologies and internal systems. Topics included web application redesigns and base functionality, Java JSP and servlet development, and web testing techniques.
\BulletItem
As a Java team lead, I was responsible for a small team of developers. Since this was the first job after college for some, as we reviewed their code I would see opportunities to mentor them on advanced Java and JavaScript concepts and topics.
